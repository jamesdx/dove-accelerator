# git (Agile & DevOps Context)

This document outlines the typical timing and creation of various architectural artifacts throughout the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), emphasizing iterative refinement and the close relationship between architecture and the Agile/DevOps methodologies.

**Phase 1: Requirements and Inception**

*   **Business Architecture (High-Level):**
    *   **When:**  Early in Phase 1. This is an initial, high-level view.  It provides context for the upcoming technical work.
    *   **Purpose:** To understand the customer's business goals, processes, and capabilities.  Sets the "why" for the software.
    *   **Content:** Business capability map, high-level process diagrams, stakeholder analysis, business rules.
    *   **Agile/DevOps Relevance:** Guides product vision, backlog prioritization, and initial estimations.
    *   **Deliverables:** High-level Business Architecture document.
    *   **Roles:** Business Analyst, Product Owner, Enterprise Architect.

**Phase 2: Design and Architecture**

*   **Solution Architecture:**
    *   **When:** Early in Phase 2. This is the overarching architecture that ties everything together.
    *   **Purpose:** Provides a holistic view of how all architectural elements will work together to address the customer's needs.  A high-level blueprint.
    *   **Content:**  Summary of Business Architecture, System Architecture, Application Architecture, Data Architecture, Security Architecture, Integration Architecture, Infrastructure Architecture, and Deployment Architecture.  High-level diagrams showing the relationships between components.
    *   **Agile/DevOps Relevance:** Guides the technical design and serves as a reference for subsequent iterations. This is a high-level vision to keep all teams aligned.
    *   **Deliverables:** Solution Architecture document (living document).
    *   **Roles:** Solution Architect, Enterprise Architect.

*   **Business Architecture (Refined):**
    *   **When:** Throughout Phase 2, iteratively refined based on detailed requirements.
    *   **Purpose:** More detailed view to support the technical design.
    *   **Content:** Detailed business process models, data flows, business rules, etc.  More granular than the initial high-level view.
    *   **Agile/DevOps Relevance:**  Provides clarity for the development team during sprint planning. Continuously improved based on feedback.
    *   **Deliverables:** Updated Business Architecture documentation.
    *   **Roles:** Business Analyst, Product Owner, Enterprise Architect.

*   **System Architecture:**
    *   **When:**  Early to mid-Phase 2.  This should be the most important thing in this phase.
    *   **Purpose:** Defines the overall structure and components of the system, including interactions between them.
    *   **Content:** Component diagrams, high-level deployment diagrams, technology stack decisions, major APIs, messaging patterns, data flows. Non-functional requirements (NFRs) are fully detailed here.
    *   **Agile/DevOps Relevance:** Must be flexible, support automation, and enable continuous delivery.
    *   **Deliverables:** System Architecture document (living document).
    *   **Roles:** Software Architect, Technical Leads.

*   **Application Architecture:**
    *   **When:** Mid-Phase 2, usually after the system architecture is largely defined.
    *   **Purpose:** Detailed design of the individual applications within the system.
    *   **Content:** Component diagrams, class diagrams, interaction diagrams, internal API specifications, framework choices, layering.
    *   **Agile/DevOps Relevance:** Guides the development process within sprints, promotes modularity, supports independent testing, and allows for parallel development.
    *   **Deliverables:** Application Architecture document (living document).
    *   **Roles:** Software Architect, Application Developers, Technical Leads.

*   **Data Architecture:**
    *   **When:** Mid-Phase 2, often in parallel with Application Architecture.
    *   **Purpose:** Defines how data will be structured, stored, accessed, and managed.
    *   **Content:**  Data model (Entity-Relationship Diagrams), database schemas, data storage technologies, data integration strategies.
    *   **Agile/DevOps Relevance:** Supports scalability, data consistency, security. Database schema should allow for iterative updates.
    *   **Deliverables:** Data Architecture document, database schema design.
    *   **Roles:** Data Architect, Database Administrator, Technical Leads.

*   **Security Architecture:**
    *   **When:** Phase 2, ideally concurrently with System and Application Architectures. Security should be considered from the very start (shift-left security).
    *   **Purpose:** Defines security considerations across the system.
    *   **Content:** Authentication, authorization, access control, data encryption, security protocols, threat modeling, vulnerability management, compliance requirements.
    *   **Agile/DevOps Relevance:**  Security needs to be embedded throughout the development lifecycle, and security testing must be automated.
    *   **Deliverables:** Security Architecture document.
    *   **Roles:** Security Architect, Security Engineers, Developers.

*   **Integration Architecture:**
    *   **When:** Phase 2, often developed iteratively with System Architecture and API design.
    *   **Purpose:** Defines how the system interacts with other systems.
    *   **Content:** API specifications, messaging protocols, data exchange formats, integration patterns, external dependencies, error handling strategies.
    *   **Agile/DevOps Relevance:**  APIs need to be well-defined and documented. Integration should be automated as much as possible.
    *   **Deliverables:** Integration Architecture document, API specifications.
    *   **Roles:** Integration Architects, Software Architects, Developers.

*   **Deployment Architecture:**
    *   **When:** Phase 2. Provides a high-level view and is refined in Phase 5.
    *   **Purpose:** Defines how the software will be deployed in different environments.
    *   **Content:** Deployment topology, deployment tools, infrastructure requirements (high-level), rollback strategies, environment configurations (high-level).
    *   **Agile/DevOps Relevance:**  Supports continuous delivery and deployment; automation is key.
    *   **Deliverables:** Deployment Architecture document (high-level).
    *   **Roles:** DevOps Engineers, Operations Engineers, System Administrators.

*   **Infrastructure Architecture:**
    *   **When:** Primarily Phase 2, but refined in later phases based on feedback and deployment needs.
    *   **Purpose:** Defines the underlying infrastructure that supports the system.
    *   **Content:** Server specifications, network topology, storage solutions, cloud provider details, virtualization and containerization technologies (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).
    *   **Agile/DevOps Relevance:** Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is key. Automation is central to the infrastructure architecture.
    *   **Deliverables:** Infrastructure Architecture document (living document).
    *   **Roles:** DevOps Engineers, Cloud Engineers, System Administrators.


**Phase 3: Development and Construction**

*   All architecture artifacts are revisited and refined as needed based on ongoing development and testing feedback.

**Phase 4: Testing and Integration**

*   Architecture artifacts are validated and updated based on testing results.

**Phase 5: Deployment and Operations**

*   Deployment Architecture is finalized and implemented.
*   Infrastructure Architecture is finalized, and the system is deployed.
*   The Operations Architecture is put in place, including monitoring tools and procedures.

**Phase 6: Maintenance and Evolution**

*   All architecture artifacts are continuously reviewed and updated in response to user feedback, changing business needs, and any technological improvements.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Iterative Refinement:**  Architectural artifacts are *living documents* and should be continually reviewed and updated based on feedback and changing needs.
*   **Collaboration:**  Close collaboration between architects, developers, operations, and security teams is essential.
*   **Automation:**  Leverage automation wherever possible, particularly in infrastructure management and deployment.

This revised document provides a more comprehensive overview of architectural artifact creation and their placement throughout an Agile and DevOps-driven SDLC.  The key improvements are a more precise placement of each architecture type in the overall lifecycle and explicit reference to the iterative nature of each.
