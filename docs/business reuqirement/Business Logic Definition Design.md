### Business Logic: Definition, Design, and Implementation

Business logic, in a nutshell, is the set of rules, algorithms, and processes that define how a software system operates and accomplishes the customer's business goals. It's the core functionality that makes the software valuable.

#### Phase 1: Requirements and Inception (Understanding the "What" and "Why")

Where Business Logic Begins: The seeds of the business logic are planted in this phase.
How:
Customer Engagement and Needs Identification:
The customer describes their business problem and desired outcomes. This is the starting point for defining the business logic.
The team begins to understand the "why" behind the software.
Requirements Elicitation, Analysis, and Prioritization:
Business analysts and product owners translate customer needs into user stories and use cases.
Each user story contains some element of business logic. For example, "As a customer, I want to be able to add items to my shopping cart so that I can purchase them." This implies business logic for inventory, pricing, and shopping cart management.
Non-functional requirements (NFRs) can also influence business logic. For example, "The system must be able to handle 10,000 concurrent users," which implies business logic for scalability and performance.
The business rules are defined.
Business Architecture (High-Level):
The business process, and the business rule will be defined.
Feasibility and Sprint Planning:
The feasibility of implementing the business logic is assessed.
High-level architectural decisions are made, which may constrain or enable the business logic.
Business Architecture (Refined):
The business process, data flow, and business rule will be refined.
Key Activities: Defining business needs, understanding business processes, writing user stories, identifying business rules.
Key Roles: Business Analysts, Product Owners, Stakeholders.
#### Phase 2: Design and Architecture (Defining the "How")

Where Business Logic is Designed: This is where the structure of the business logic is created.
How:
Solution Architecture:
The Solution Architect define the system to achieve the customer goal.
System Architecture:
The high-level structure of the system is designed to support the business logic. For example, a microservices architecture might be chosen to isolate different business capabilities.
The key components, API will be defined.
Application Architecture:
The specific application components that will implement the business logic are designed.
The layering (e.g., presentation, business logic, data access) is defined.
Internal APIs and service boundaries are defined.
The pattern will be chosen to develop the business logic.
Detailed Design and Data Architecture:
Detailed designs for the components that will implement the business logic are created.
Algorithms and data structures are selected.
Database schemas are defined to store the data used by the business logic.
The data flow for business process will be defined.
Security Architecture:
define the security strategy for the system.
Key Activities: Defining component interactions, selecting design patterns, designing internal APIs, defining algorithms, designing data structures and databases.
Key Roles: Software Architects, Technical Leads, Developers.
#### Phase 3: Development and Construction (Implementing the "How")

Where Business Logic is Implemented: This is where the business logic is brought to life in code.
How:
Coding and Implementation:
Developers write the code that implements the business rules, algorithms, and processes, in the Application Component.
For example, they write code to calculate discounts, process orders, validate user input, etc.
The business logic will be implemented in the right application layer.
Unit Testing:
Unit tests are written to verify that the code correctly implements the business logic.
TDD (Test-Driven Development) is ideal because it ensures that the tests verify the business rules.
Key Activities: Writing code, implementing algorithms, writing unit tests.
Key Roles: Developers, Quality Assurance Engineers.
#### Phase 4: Testing and Integration (Validating the "How")

Where Business Logic is Validated: This phase ensures that the implemented business logic works as intended, both in isolation and when integrated with other parts of the system.
How:
Continuous Integration and Integration Testing:
Automated tests are run to ensure that the integrated system components implement the business logic correctly.
For example, an integration test might check if an order can be created and that the inventory is reduced.
System Testing:
System tests verify that the entire system correctly implements the business logic and meets non-functional requirements.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
The customer tests the system to verify that it meets their business needs. UAT confirms that the business logic is implemented correctly from the user's perspective.
Key Activities: Writing and running integration tests, writing and running system tests, supporting customer UAT.
Key Roles: Quality Assurance Engineers, Test Automation Engineers, Developers, Customers.
#### Phase 5: Deployment and Operations (Running the "How")

Where Business Logic is Deployed and Operated: This phase makes the business logic available to users.
How:
Continuous Delivery and Deployment:
The software, including the business logic, is deployed to production.
Monitoring and Operations:
The system is monitored to ensure that the business logic is running correctly and efficiently.
Key Activities: Deployment, system monitoring, performance tuning.
Key Roles: Operations Engineers, DevOps Engineers, System Administrators.
#### Phase 6: Maintenance and Evolution (Improving the "How")

Where Business Logic is Refined: This phase involves fixing bugs, improving performance, and adding new business features.
How:
Maintenance and Support:
Bugs in the business logic are identified and fixed.
Evolution and Enhancement:
New or changed business rules are implemented.
The business logic is adapted to meet changing business needs.
The user feedback will be collected to improve the business logic.
This often triggers a new iteration of the SDLC (back to Phase 1 or Phase 2).
Key Activities: Bug fixing, coding new features, gathering user feedback, planning new releases.
Key Roles: Developers, Support Engineers, Product Owners, Business Analysts.
### In Summary

Business logic is defined iteratively and progressively throughout the SDLC.
Phase 1 and Phase 2 are critical for understanding and defining the structure of the business logic.
Phase 3 is where the business logic is turned into code.
Phases 4-6 validate, run, and improve the implemented business logic.
Every phase have the related business logic.
